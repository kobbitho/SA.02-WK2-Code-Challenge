#### By Tabitha Akinyi Okoth

## Introduction

This code challenge has three parts that are going to test what we have learnt so far.

## Description

### i. The Quick Brown Fox

Here we write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.



### ii. Generate an Array

In this this challenge we write a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7] and -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].



### iii. Prime Numbers

This  task requires a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. 
the function should accurately identify prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array. For example an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].
